For Emerging Technologies, we have four tasks to do regarding trigram models. We are using a jupyter notebook for these tasks and are required to support our work with relevant references.


# ELIZA Chatbot

This is a client-side implementation of the ELIZA chatbot, originally created by Joseph Weizenbaum in 1966. The chatbot simulates a conversation by using basic pattern-matching techniques to respond to user input. This project uses plain JavaScript for logic and HTML/CSS for the user interface.
