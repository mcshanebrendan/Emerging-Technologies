# Jupyter Notebook Tasks 1-4

For more specified information on the tasks and references, please have a look at the markdown part of the Trigrams Jupyter Notebook. For these tasks I was required to do some research on specific topics related to the tasks. While at first I found this all a bit of a challenge, I then realised that there is some really good information out there online on these topics. 

Here is an example of some of my refernces for these tasks: (note that the references are in my ipynb file in full)


Analyzing Language Models and Text Generation Performance

Jurafsky, D., & Martin, J. H. (2008). Speech and Language Processing: An Introduction to Natural Language Processing, Computational Linguistics, and Speech Recognition (2nd ed.). Prentice Hall. Available at: https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/ This book provides insights into methods for analyzing and interpreting results from language models like n-grams. I used it to guide my approach in evaluating and interpreting the performance of my generated text based on trigrams.

Language Model Evaluation Techniques

Shannon, C. E. (1948). A Mathematical Theory of Communication. Bell System Technical Journal, 27, 379–423. Available at: https://people.math.harvard.edu/~ctm/home/text/others/shannon/entropy/entropy.pdf Shannon’s research provides a basis for evaluating information content and coherence in generated text. I referenced this work to support my evaluation metrics for analyzing the quality of text generated by my trigram model.

Python Libraries for Data Analysis

Python Software Foundation. (n.d.). Python’s Statistics and Analysis Modules. Available at: https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html I used Python’s built-in libraries for calculating statistical measures like averages and distributions in my analysis, referencing official documentation to ensure accurate data handling and analysis in this task.

# ELIZA Chatbot 

## ELIZA GITHUB PAGES LINK: https://mcshanebrendan.github.io/Emerging-Technologies/

## I changed the /eliza folder to /docs for github pages

This is a client-side implementation of the ELIZA chatbot, originally created by Joseph Weizenbaum in 1966. The chatbot simulates a conversation by using basic pattern-matching techniques to respond to user input. This project uses plain JavaScript for logic and HTML/CSS for the user interface.
